# Hamster Hangout
By Hustling Hamsters

## What is Hamster Hangout?
Hamster Hangout is a simple command line program that provides an interactive “conversation” for users to record various aspects of their day. These are across a range of categories such as: mood, sleep, activities, and more. This app will save these records for users to come back to, compare previous statistics in various categories from previous records,  and provide and positive and motivating atmosphere to make an enjoyable and personalised journaling experience. 
### The technologies we used
We have built Hamster Hangout in C++ with no external libraries, using the Open Source CMake software for cross-platform development. 
### Features we hope to implement in the future

## How to use Hamster Hangout
Hamster Hangout can be easily used by responding to prompts given by Hammy (the hamster). These could be numbered for mood rating, or long answer when asked more detailed questions. The command line interface also offers a variety of options for logging, seeing previous records, and getting extra information about the application. All of the users generated journals are stored in their ``Users/Desktop`` path so they are easily able to navigate to them.
