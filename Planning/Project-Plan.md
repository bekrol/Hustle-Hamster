# Project Plan

## The team
**Katie Wink**\
Third year Computer Science student. Experience in Java, C/C++, Python and web development. Also have lots of experience in science communication and digital media which has developed my skills in effectively explaining complex problems to an audience. 

**Rebekah Rolleston**\
Third year Computer Science and Information Science student. Previous experience in website development for friends businesses as well as work experience in event management and planning. University experience largely in Java, as well as some Python and R for Data Science, and basic understanding of C.

**Mary O’Leary**\
Currently in my final year of my computer science and neuroscience degree. I have lots of experience writing reports, coding in object oriented languages and writing command line programs. Have also had the opportunity to do lots of team groupwork using an Agile methodology. 

**Abby Fernandes**\
Third year computer science and biochemistry student with experience in Java, C/C++ and web development. Enjoys comprehensive planning, which is useful for the first assignment and the general software development process. 

## What we are building
We are building a simple command line program that provides an interactive “conversation” to allow users to record various aspects of their day. These aspectes will be from a range of categories: mood, sleep, activities, and more. This app will save these records for users to come back to, compare previous statistics in various categories from previous records, and give motivation to hopefully make a more personalised and enjoyable journaling experience.

## Back to basics
This application will be built purely in C++ with no external libraries, running in the command line interface.

Alongside the environment it is built in, the functioning of this app is very “basic” with the user simply responding to prompts from the program to create journal entries. There are no complex UI functions or concepts to figure out before the app is usable. Our application will function as a basic conversation, which will be intuitive and require minimal effort on the users behalf to enter their data. 

## How we are going to build our application
### Methodology
We will be building this application using C++.

We will aim to develop this application using the agile software development methodology. While we still intend to do some initial planning before we begin development, implementing this methodology will allow us to more confidently reach the tight assignment deadlines by making use of iterative design and development to ensure working software is produced in time for the Alpha and Beta due dates.

We will use our due dates for assignments as sprints, which will give us 3 weeks each sprint to complete the tasks that we scheduled. We will also use the Trello board similarly to a kanban board, uploading tasks and issues when they arise.

### Monitoring process
To ensure that the Hustle Hangout application is on schedule and frequently delivering working software we will implement the following monitoring processes and documentation:
- Trello as a ticketing system
  - At the start of each sprint (working towards assignments) all tasks from the schedule will be created as cards in the ‘To Do’ list.
  - As team members work on and complete tasks they will then be  moved into the “In Progress” and “In Review/testing” lists
  - If any member is having problems with a task, the card can be moved into the “Stuck” list
  - All to be reviewed and reported in weekly catch ups
- Meeting minutes
  - Any time the team meets, notes will be taken to record all points discussed.
  - Any ideas, issues, thoughts on the project will be recorded
  - These meeting are likely to occur frequently throughout the week and be informal
- Formal catch-ups (twice weekly)
  - Full review of how the previous period has progressed
  - Template for this can be found in the Google Drive: COSC345 > Monitoring > Formal Catch Ups. *can this just be linked?*

## Market research
### What already exists
**Day One (IOS)**\
Day One is a journaling app that works more similarly to a traditional paper and pen journal. This app allows you to have multiple journals and add journal entries whenever you please. This app does not track anything more than keeping storage for the user submitted blurbs. It is more similar to the IOS notes app. This application is also pay to use. 

**Grid Diary (Cross Platform)**\
Grid diary is a journaling app that gives the user prompts to fill in. It will ask questions such as “What are you grateful for today?”, or “How much money did you spend today?”.This does not ask for values, but for each question a long form answer is asked. Every day gives recurring questions and some extra questions, you can also go back in your timeline and see what you had said for previous days. This application has a free version, but long time users will have to pay for premium.

**Journey.Cloud**\
Journey.Cloud is a tracking app that also works as a cloud app. You can journal, add photos, videos, track your mood and see how this has changed over the last month. This app is more similar to a social media cloud that combined with a tracking app, which is somewhat more complicated. However, tracking mood and being able to look back over how the user's mood has changed over a certain amount of time is something we want to develop. 

### Customer interest
Many studies have been done and proven that there are so many benefits to daily journaling. Despite this many people either don’t journal or don’t have the time to fit this into their daily schedule. With our app we propose a command line “Chatbot” that makes journaling an easy and positive experience! This way the journaling can be done simple, just after doing work and will prompt users to answer either yes/no or pick a number rating on a scale. This way we can still get valuable user information, without asking the user to think too hard. It will be an easy wind-down and reflection of the day.
